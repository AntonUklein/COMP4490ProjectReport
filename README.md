# COMP4490ProjectReport

Computer graphics report. Unfortunately, as a sizable amount of code is not mine, but my professor's, and I did not clear distribution rights for it, the only part that I have publicly posted is the report.

My project was to try and take the raytracing project, which took several minutes to render a scene, and attempt to speed it up to run in realtime. This sadly does not use a proper multithreading queue or GPU-powered processing due to me suffering from limitations due to deadlines.

All of the rendering is done on the CPU. Vague performance numbers are in the report.
